## 🎥 **Recording Best Practices**

### **📋 Pre-Recording Checklist**
- [ ] Server running (`npm start` completed)
- [ ] Browser at correct URL (`http://localhost:4200/agent-demo`)
- [ ] Audio levels tested
- [ ] Demo script rehearsed
- [ ] Screen clean (no distracting elements)
- [ ] Zoom level at 100%
- [ ] Notifications turned off

### **🎬 During Recording**
- **Speak slowly and clearly** (judges need to understand)
- **Use your mouse to point** to important elements
- **Pause between sections** for editing flexibility
- **Stay enthusiastic** but professional
- **Don't rush** - better to be clear than fast

### **⚡ Quick Recovery Tips**
- **If you make a mistake**: Pause, say "Let me show that again" and redo
- **If page loads slowly**: Say "While this loads, let me explain..."
- **If something breaks**: Have backup recording ready

## 🚀 **One-Take Recording Strategy**

### **Option A: Single 5-Minute Take**
- Record everything in one continuous take
- More authentic but riskier
- Practice 2-3 times before recording

### **Option B: Multiple Segments** 
- Record each section separately
- Edit together later
- Safer but requires video editing

### **Option C: Live Demo with Narration**
- Record yourself using the app naturally
- Add narration in post-production
- Most professional but complex

## 🎯 **Video Upload & Sharing**

### **📤 Upload Platforms**
- **YouTube** (unlisted/public) - most compatible
- **Vimeo** - professional quality
- **Loom** - easy sharing with direct links
- **Google Drive** - if file size requirements

### **🔗 Submission Format**
- **Include video link** in hackathon submission
- **Add backup download link** (Google Drive/Dropbox)
- **Write 2-3 sentence description** for context

### **📝 Video Description Template**
