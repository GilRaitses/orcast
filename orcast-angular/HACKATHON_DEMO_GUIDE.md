- **Scientific accuracy** with real marine data
- **Professional-grade** tools for orca research
- **Seamless user journey** from input to saved plans

## 🏆 **Judges' Questions - Prepared Answers**

### **"How does this differ from existing trip planners?"**
> *"Traditional trip planners are generic. We use multi-agent AI with real marine biology data, orca behavior models, and environmental forecasting to optimize for actual wildlife encounters, not just tourist attractions."*

### **"What's the technical innovation here?"**
> *"We've combined Gemma 3 multi-agent orchestration with physics-informed neural networks, real-time environmental APIs, and marine biology expertise to create the first AI trip planner optimized for scientific wildlife research."*

### **"How scalable is this approach?"**
> *"The multi-agent architecture is completely modular. We can add new agents for different species, locations, or activities. The same system could plan bird watching in Costa Rica or aurora viewing in Iceland."*

### **"What's your data source validation?"**
> *"We integrate verified data from NOAA, OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System), University of Washington whale research, and OrcaHello acoustic detection networks. This isn't just tourism - it's science-grade planning."*
