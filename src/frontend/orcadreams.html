            When I watched <span class="italic">that movie</span> I used to sit on the edge of my seat and wait for the scene where he breaches and the sensation always carried me away. I did not understand that if I would only find a way to encounter it in its world to make it subside. That feeling also twisted and pulled and nudged and scratched the minds of my peers who also had dreams and drew pictures that would not satisfy that hunger. To witness in its full glory, the breaching whale had nothing to do with wanting some freedom from our own lives, but for the orca. But as a foundational memory, the words to understand it were limited, so in most the idea remained a fire and burning desire to see a tormented and beautiful creature yearning for freedom in captivity until that glorious day when the orca found the strength to jump over the jetty and with its flight over the stones and the open sea ahead and fluke arched, soaring while water dripped off it and poured into my dreams.
