In the late fall you can hear humpbacks, and in the summer male harbor seals vocalize nearby.</p>\n\n<p>Hydrophones have been deployed here since 2002, usually just outside the kelp, less than 30m offshore. Orcasound Lab is hosted by Val and Leslie Veirs and funded by <a href=\"http://www.beamreach.blue/\" target=\"_blank\">Beam Reach</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Status update 3/29/2025: </strong>60Hz hum suggests a cable failure. A-team will investigate this week and aim to repair by 4/4/25....</p>\n<p><strong>Status update 12/23/2024:</strong> A new binaural stand with Aquarian hydrophones on 60m cables built by Val was deployed between winter rain storms by David Howitt with shoreside assistance from ?? and Tom Hogan. Can you hear whether sounds are to your left (south) or right (north)?</p>\n<p><strong>Status update 12/05/2024:</strong> Thanks to diver David Howitt, we know the cable was severed. The stream is now offline as we await new Aquarian hydrophones and a weather window to deploy them.</p>\n<p><strong>Status update 11/20/2024:</strong> The windstorm has damaged the HTI hydrophone. Please stand by while we work on a repair or replacement plan...</p>\n<p><strong>Status update:12/26/2023:</strong> The current hydrophone is an HTI at a depth of about 5 meters with intertidal tie-downs. It starting buzzing sometime recently. We will bring it back on line soon. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.orcasound.net/portfolio/orcasound-lab-hydrophone/\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about the Orcasound Lab node</a>.</p>",

        "intro_html": "<p>This is a great place to listen for the Southern Resident killer whales who pass through Admiralty Inlet about once a month in search of salmon. Other common sounds here come from ships heading to and from the Ports of Seattle and Tacoma, and recreational vessels using the adjacent boat ramp.</p>\n\n<p>A hydrophone system designed by Lon Brocklehurst and Ken Balcomb was deployed in 2018, with 3 elements deployed 200m offshore at a depth of 16.5m by diver Florian Grainer. After only a month, the long cable failed. Since then, 1-2 hydrophones have been deployed at the base of the deepest pilings. Their depth is only ~1m, so they dry at some negative tides and you may then hear seabird sounds!</p>\n\n<p>The Bush Point node is hosted by <a href=\"https://orcanetwork.org/\">Orca Network</a> with logistical support from Bush Point Wharf and financial support from <a href=\"https://www.whidbeytel.com/giving-back/\">WhidbeyTel</a> (Internet service and monetary donations).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.orcasound.net/portfolio/bush-point-hydrophone/\">Learn more about the Bush Point node</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Status update 5/28/2025:</strong> A new hydrophone has been successfully deployed by Trevor Snow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Status update 4/29/2025:</strong> Hydrophone is under repair and not streaming. Trevor and field assistants are working on a replacement for the old hydrophone that was causing strong 60Hz hum system noise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Status update 11/16/2023:</strong> Thanks to Trevor Snow of Orca Network supported by WhidbeyTel, the Bush Point hydrophone system has been overhauled with new equipment funded by WDFW (see below). The wharf was badly damaged over the winter of 2022-23 and repairs will likely enable a deeper deployment in 2024.</p>\n\n<p>A 2023 upgrade to this node was funded by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife through The Department of Ecology\u2019s Equipment Grant program to improve location detection of Southern Resident Killer Whales and other marine mammals during oil spills (SPPREG-2123-WaSDFW-00025).</p>",
